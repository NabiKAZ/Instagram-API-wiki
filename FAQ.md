### My photos/videos are removed just after upload

In that case, Instagram has flagged your account/IP as spam, try from a different location and remove the cookies inside `data` folder, and do not do spam.

### Uploading videos doesnt work

It works. Make sure the media is compatible and you have `ffmpeg` installed. More info: https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/wiki/Dependencies

### How to extract Instagram Signature Key

It's explained here: https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/wiki/Technical-information

### Instagram has changed my password

When you login from different locations, to avoid someone gets into your account, Instagram does that, its a security measure.

### Instagram registration doesn't work

It does. Check your code. If your IP is flagged you won't be able to create any account.
